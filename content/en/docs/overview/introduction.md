## What is ArtifactDB?

ArtifactDB is a file storage system with searchable metadata, versioning, and access control.
It was initially developed to manage data and results generated by genomics workflows inside Genentech,
but can be generally used to store any arbitrary file and its associated metadata.
Users can then search this metadata for interesting files and, once found, download them for further analysis.
So, if you've got some files, and they have some metadata, you can store them inside an ArtifactDB deployment.

## ArtifactDB features

- Flexible storage of arbitrary files and accompanying metadata.
- Customization and enforcement of metadata standards via schemas.
- High-performance search on metadata fields.
- Cloud-native implementation for scalability and accessibility.
- Versioning and immutability of files for reproducibility.
- Fine-grained access control for public and private resources.
- Extensible clients providing analysis-ready data structures.

## Why use ArtifactDB?

Data management is difficult in a research environment where the format of datasets and analysis results are constantly changing.
Still, we want to capture these artifacts in a FAIR manner to enable their later re-use, e.g., in meta-analyses or data integration.
ArtifactDB marries customizable metadata with flexible file storage, allowing scientists to store their data with useful annotation.
When combined with application-specific clients, ArtifactDB fits seamlessly into your existing data science workflows to level up your data standards.
